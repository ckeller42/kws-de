# Paper / talk notes — running research log

Raw material for a concise conference-style paper + slide deck. Every substantive result,
design decision, and lesson lands here **as it happens** — with real numbers only.
Working title: *"Offline German voice control on a microcontroller: keyword spotting with a
slot grammar on the ESP32-S3."*

## 1. Problem & motivation

- Goal: hands-free German control of camper functions (lights, heater, fridge, roof, …),
  **fully offline** on an always-on, low-power device (ESP32-S3, M5Stack CoreS3).
- Constraint driving everything: no cloud, no Pi awake 24/7 — the voice satellite must be
  the cheap always-on part.
- Gap: no open-source on-device speech-to-intent for MCUs exists. Vendor stacks:
  ESP-SR/MultiNet = Chinese/English only (no German); Picovoice Rhino does German
  slot-filling but is closed-source. → Our niche: **open, German, MCU-class, intent-level**.

## 2. Contributions (draft list)

1. A reproducible **model factory** for German KWS on ESP32-S3: MSWC subset fetch → MFCC →
   DS-CNN → full-INT8 TFLite-Micro, with CI **resource-budget gates** (size/MACs/INT8/ops)
   that prove device-fit without hardware.
2. An honest treatment of **synthetic-data provenance**: per-word real/TTS counts, headline
   metrics computed on real speech only, TTS-heavy classes explicitly flagged.
3. A **two-stage architecture**: reused wake-word engine (microWakeWord, shown to train
   locally on Apple Silicon — no Colab/GPU) gating a streaming keyword detector + a **pure,
   device-specific grammar** (`device → zone? → action`, per-device action validity) — the
   open-source alternative to closed speech-to-intent.
4. A **full-command-catalog end-to-end evaluation**: every valid intent synthesized and run
   through audio → MFCC → streaming detector → grammar → intent.

## 3. Experiments & results (real, measured)

### E1 — v1 single-word KWS (5 toggle words, 7 classes)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Headline real-speech INT8 accuracy (TTS excluded) | **91.1 %** (n=775, mixed 20/10/0 dB SNR) |
| Float accuracy (same subset) | 91.7 % |
| Full-model INT8 (incl. TTS-augmented classes) | 93.2 % |
| `_unknown_` false-accept | 0.0 % |
| SNR sweep (commands, INT8) | 93.0 % clean → 84.6 % @ 0 dB |
| Model | 19,256 B, 2,069,984 MACs, full-INT8, 5,351 params |
| Reference point | ESP-SR MultiNet ~85–95 % English, clean speech |

Per-word INT8: Kühlschrank 96.3, Camping 98.4 (TTS-heavy ⚠), Wasser 93.2, Heizung 90.9,
Licht 85.7 (short word ↔ silence confusions — see confusion matrix in eval-report).

Data provenance (the honesty story): MSWC-de real clips found: Licht 300, Kühlschrank 300,
Heizung 120, Camping 22, Wasser 0→300 (a deeper scan found real clips mid-run; headline
moved 87.9 % → 91.1 % — *worth a slide: data > model tweaks*).

### E2 — MSWC-de coverage study (why TTS is unavoidable)

Scanned ~2.5 M MSWC-de examples: of the 24 grounded v2 command words, only **7 have real
clips** (Licht, Kühlschrank, Heizung, Wasser, aus, auf, Außen[158]); 17 incl. all zone words,
`an`, and every level/mode word have **zero**. → Synthetic fill is structural, not a hack.

### E3 — v2 grounded catalog model (26 classes) + end-to-end catalog eval

- Vocabulary grounded in the camper's real controllable functions (8 devices, 4 light
  zones, 12 actions, device-specific validity map) — invalid combinations are rejected by
  the grammar, not learned by the model.
- *(results pending — training + catalog eval running; insert per-command intent-accuracy
  table, overall full-intent accuracy, SNR sweep here when the run lands)*

### E4 — wake word, local training feasibility

microWakeWord (the ESPHome/HA wake engine) documented as Python-3.10 + Colab/GPU;
**shown to install and import in a local uv-managed 3.10 venv on Apple Silicon** (TF 2.21,
CPU/Metal). → custom "Hey Bus" trainable on a laptop. *(FA/hour numbers pending.)*

### E5 — TTS voice diversity (planned ablation)

Hypothesis: synthetic-data quality for KWS is dominated by **voice diversity**, not
per-voice fidelity. Setup: macOS `say` only (~9 voices) vs multi-engine
(say + Piper ~7 + Parler prompt-voices, round-robin) on the 17 zero-real words.
*(numbers pending — compare catalog accuracy of both trainings)*

## 4. Method details worth a figure

- Two-stage always-on architecture (LikeC4 diagrams in `docs/likec4/` — reuse for slides).
- Golden-vector MFCC contract: host (librosa) and device (esp-dsp) front-ends pinned
  bit-level by a fixed-input fixture test — kills the classic silent train/deploy mismatch.
- Budget gates as CI: "fits the MCU" as a unit test (≤500 KB / ≤3 M MACs / INT8-only ops).
- Speaker-disjoint splits everywhere; TTS clips split by voice+rate combo (a synthetic
  "speaker") so voices never straddle train/test.
- Streaming detector: posterior smoothing + threshold + refractory debounce
  (found + fixed a real off-by-one: decrement-then-check let a sustained word re-fire).

## 5. War stories / lessons (talk material)

- **Data beats scanning:** Wasser had 0 clips after 2.5 M examples scanned; more scanning
  was pure waste — the fix was TTS + (later) a lucky deeper index. Know when coverage has
  converged.
- **Silent failure modes:** `subprocess.run("say", …)` without a timeout deadlocked a
  12-way thread pool → whole data build hung at 0.1 % CPU. Bound every external call.
- **`python -m pkg.mod` ≠ console script** when the module lacks a `__main__` block —
  an entire train→export→eval chain "succeeded" as a no-op. Verify artifacts, not exit codes.
- **License landscape for German TTS** (HF survey): permissive core = Piper + Parler-TTS
  (Apache); XTTS-v2/MMS are non-commercial — matters for a public/commercial artifact.

## 6. Slide-deck skeleton (draft)

2. Why not X? (MultiNet no German / Rhino closed / Rhasspy needs a Pi)
3. Architecture (LikeC4 deployment + device views)
